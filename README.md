# 🩺 Diabetes Prediction

This project focuses on building a machine learning model to predict whether a person has diabetes based on health-related features. It uses the Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset.

## 📊 Dataset

The dataset used is the **Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset**, which includes the following features:

- Pregnancies
- Glucose
- Blood Pressure
- Skin Thickness
- Insulin
- BMI
- Diabetes Pedigree Function
- Age
- Outcome (0 = No Diabetes, 1 = Diabetes)

You can download the dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/pima-indians-diabetes-database
